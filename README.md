## About me ##
My front end journey is mostly self-guided and self-taught, and I am using a variety of free sources. I started on 17 September 2021.

## This Repo ##
The Free Code Camp site has been a great tool in learning HTML and CSS, and I have made my way through their Responsive Web Development course, and these are my projects at the end of it.
